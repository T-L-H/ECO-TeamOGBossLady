    <h2>Climate change is a long term effect regarding the average weather patterns that define Earth's global, regional and local climates. These changes have been distinguished since the early 20th century and are predominantly driven by human activities such as:</h2>
    <p>Burning fossil fuel (coal, oil and gas): The act of burning fossil fuel was first started in the 1880s, where coal was used to generate electricity for homes and factories. Fossil fuels are burned in order to generate electricity, we use this in modern day to power transportation such as cars, planes and is used in industrial processes such as the manufacturing of food, beverages, petroleum, ceramics, base metals, coal, plastic and wood, etc.</p>
    <p>Cutting down forests: The start of deforestation is estimated to have taken place approximately 10,000 years ago, it is estimated 40-50% of the earth's original forest has vanished. Humans have been cutting trees down in order to use for building, furniture and paper usage. A lot of deforestation has taken place for the benefit of individuals. Trees are a benefit in the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When trees are cut down, the valuable effect is lost and the carbon stored into the trees is released into the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Increasing livestock animals: In the 1920s, industrial scale farming began and chickens became the first factory farmed animal. Chickens were raised indoors in tremendous quantities for egg production and slaughter. In the 1960s, global livestock increased substantially, and beef production more than doubled. This is due to new technology, including larger tractors, the use of chemicals, and encouragement of government operations. The increase of livestock produces a large amount of methane when the animals digest their food. Methane is a hazardous air pollutant and a greenhouse gas. The exposure to this air causes 1 million premature deaths per year.</p>
