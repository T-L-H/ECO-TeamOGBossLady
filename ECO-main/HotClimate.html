<p>Save energy at home: A vast amount of our electricity is powered by coal, oil and gas. Use less energy in your everyday life by lowering your heating and cooling, and switching to more electricity efficient electric appliances, LED light bulbs and washing your laundry with cold water.</p>
<p>Switch to a more Eco-Friendly Vehicle: The car market is easing into the more efficient way of transportation by providing cheaper model electric and hybrid cars. When looking for your next vehicle opt in for one to help reduce pollution and significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Reduce water waste: In most developed countries, water is taken for granted and used more excessively than needed. By reducing water usage it reduces the pollution caused by burning fuel and treating water with chemicals.</p>
